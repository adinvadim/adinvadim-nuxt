# Nuxt Layer Starter

This is a simple Nuxt layer starter project designed to help you quickly set up and develop Nuxt app with a pre-configured layer structure (For me).

# Hot to add Drizzle to the project

[Drizzle with Nuxt Hub](https://hub.nuxt.com/docs/recipes/drizzle)

And then add this to the `nuxt.config.ts`

```ts
hub: {
  database: true,
},
```
